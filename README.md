# BullCows: What to know
![BullCowPic](https://i.imgur.com/LvioYF5.png)

Made with the Unreal Engine, Bull Cows is a game that revolves around guessing the **hidden word**.
This hidden word happens to be an isogram *(A word with no repeating letters).*
For every guess that is wrong, you lose a life! 
Guess the isogram to win before you lose all your lives.

When guessing the word, you are given a count for how many **bulls** and how many **cows** there are.

## What is a bull and what is a cow?

A bull is a letter that is in both your guess and the hidden word, and is in the same spot in the word.

A cow is a letter that is within both your guess and the hidden word as well. The difference is it happens to be 
in a different spot within the hidden word compared to your guess.

**Example:**

Let's say the hidden word is water and your first guess is lakes.

You would lose a life, and the game would tell you that you have **two bulls** and **zero cows**.
This is because water and lakes both have "a" and "e" in the same location (the bulls). The rest of the letters aren't shared.

Your second guess is lower. In this instance, you would have **two bulls** and **one cow**.
This is because water and lower share the "e" and the "r" in the same spot (the bulls).
The "w" is in both of the words, but the guess had it in the wrong spot (the cow).
